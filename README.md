# Hi, I'm Oy3na ðŸ‘‹  
An ambitious student who enjoys tackling challenging tasks that help him improve.

I enjoy projects that solve social problems and create apps that help people in daily life. Living in South Africa has shown me the gap in IT that we are facing and the need for innovation. Iâ€™m not saying I will fill the gap alone, but I know my contributions will go a long way in making a difference.

## Technologies & Tools  
Java | JavaScript | HTML | CSS | Python | MySQL | MongoDB

## Projects  
- Developed an NGO website focused on community engagement and awareness.  
- Built a slot machine website to sharpen my frontend and JavaScript skills.  
- Created multiple small projects across Java, Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to deepen my understanding of each language and framework.  
- Currently working on an innovative app aimed at solving real-world challenges in nightlife and transport (details coming soon).
